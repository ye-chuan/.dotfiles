# Stylus
[Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) is a browser extension that applies UserStyles which allow user defined CSS themeing on websites.

The config here applies Catppuccin Mocha with a Blue accent.

These config should be regularly updated with the open-source configs provided by the [Catppuccin Community](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles).
