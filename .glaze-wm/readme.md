# GlazeWM
The [Glaze Window Manager](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) is a featureful dynamic tiling window manager for Windows.

It is inspired by the i3 window manager from Linux.

## Comparison to other dynamic tiling window managers
### FancyWM
- FancyWM has a more awkward way of creating workspaces, which requires using the Window's virtual desktop GUI
- As of the time of writing (02/2024), FancyWM doesn't have proper workspace support for Windows 11

### Komorebi
- A close contender to GlazeWM, far more lightweight
- Inspired by bspwm instead of i3
- Doesn't allow dynamic layouts as we go (uses the concepts of pre-defined layouts from bwpwm)
- Will be trying this out too to see which one fits my workflow better

## Configuration
All configuration files are stored in and read from `~/.config/.glaze-wm/config.yaml`
