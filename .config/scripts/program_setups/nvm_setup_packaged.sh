# Some distro's nvm packages comes with the /usr/share/nvm/init-nvm.sh for us to source
# This script serves as just a pass-through until I have time to refactor the sourcing of
# shell scripts via a drop-in directory instead of the ~/.config/shell/.prgm_setup_list file

source /usr/share/nvm/init-nvm.sh
