# This file should be managed by:
# ~/.config/scripts/installer-unmanaged/installer-utilities.sh
# to contain scripts that should be sourced (e.g. in .bashrc)
# when installing programs manually (not via package manager)
#
# The format is
# - First line to be where the program setup scripts
# are stored e.g. `/home/leafboat/.config/scripts/program_setups/`
# - Subsequent lines are filenames in that directory to be sourced e.g. `pyenv_setup.sh`
#
# TODO: A drop-in directory would have been more appropriate than
#       writing to this file
