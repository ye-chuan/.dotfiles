Each folder here represents a "package" to Vim.
Each package should have a
- "start" folder (with plugins to run at startup)
- "opt" folder (with plugins to be optionally loaded with :packadd)

Of course, do check the "nvim/after/" directory for configurations to be ran after these plugins are loaded.
