# Zathura by default do not have smooth scrolling animations,
# but we could fallback to GTK's keybinds (assuming GTK is configured)
# for animated scrolling) by first unbinding them from Zathura.

# Note that these GTK scrolling methods do not loading new pages.
# Using them for too long without using any of Zathura's scroll

# <End> might not reach the last page if it hasn't been loaded yet.
